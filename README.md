# Hamoye-Data-Science-Internship.
**STAGE A**
HDSC: Introduction to Python for Machine Learning(ML)
This is my first Hamoye Internship tag along project. This graded project uses dataset that was provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and some basic EDA were performs in the dataset(FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG.csv).

The dataset consists of 12 features, namely; 'Area Code', 'Area', 'Item Code', 'Item', 'Element Code', 'Element', 'Unit', 'Y2014', 'Y2015', 'Y2016', 'Y2017' and 'Y2018'. It also has a shape of (60943, 12) respectively.
